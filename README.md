# shell-assignment
the shell assignment. we have the shell running, though it has NO functions built in functions to use it with, not even ls or echo.  will flesh out. important thing is, its up and running and compiled with no errors. also created both static and dynamic libraries, .o object files, and the resulting executable binary just named shell. (./shell will launch it). libraries are indexed with ranlib.
